# MegaWave – CoPlan MVP v0.1.0

This document tracks the initial CoPlan MVP wave.

## Targets

1. Provide a free to world, repo native master planning helper.
2. Help teams get a holistic view of messy multi repo ecosystems.
3. Emit both human readable and AI face planning artifacts.
4. Integrate cleanly with CoMasterPlan, CoSteward, and CoAgent over time.

## Countdown (v0.1.0)

- [x] Create CoPlan repo structure (docs, schema, tools, examples).
- [ ] Add minimal scan tool that walks repos and emits a plan state.
- [ ] Add TOON schema for CoPlan output (coplan_v0.1.toon).
- [ ] Add human facing quickstart and example outputs.
- [ ] Tag v0.1.0 and announce as free to world helper.

This file is non binding meta. Canonical HP lives in CoMasterPlan.
