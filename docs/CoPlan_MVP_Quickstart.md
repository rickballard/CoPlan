# CoPlan MVP Quickstart

CoPlan helps you build a living master plan for complex, messy repo suites.

## What CoPlan Does

- Scans one or more repos from a workspace.
- Collects basic structure and documentation clues.
- Emits:
  - a machine readable "plan state" file (based on `coplan_v0.1.toon`), and
  - a human readable summary document.

## Intended Use

- Organizations facing AI transition and repo sprawl.
- Teams who want a neutral planning helper without vendor lock in.
- People who liked RepoZipper and want a planning equivalent.

## Status

This is an MVP stub. The scan tool and schema are placeholders that will evolve with real usage.
