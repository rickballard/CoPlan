# CoPlan

CoPlan is an AI assisted, repo native master planning helper for messy multi repo ecosystems.

- Free to use, no strings attached.
- Designed to help organizations get a holistic view of their repos, intent, risks, and strategies.
- Built to play well with CoAgent, CoSteward, CoMasterPlan, and CoCivium style guardrails.

Initial MVP goals:

- Scan a set of repos and build a structured "plan state" summary.
- Emit both machine readable (TOON) and human readable planning artifacts.
- Stay vendor neutral and avoid lock in.
